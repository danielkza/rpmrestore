something's wrong on your system : it was working yesterday, but not today : you will
have to check what was changed

on an rpm packaged linux box, you can first look at last install with the command
rpm -qa --last

then you will look check if some files were changed since the install, with the command
rpm -Va
rpm register many attributes (owner, group, size, mode, ..) in rpm database on install.

Ok, you find some changes, how to restore original attributes of an rpm ?
rpm provide you a way (http://www.rpm.org/hintskinks/restoreperm/), but it is not very verbose

rpmrestore comes to produce a mode detailed output than "rpm -V", and allow partial, interactive restore.
